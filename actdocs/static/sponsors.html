<p>
A conference like the London Perl Workshop which offers a great community event at no cost to its attendees is reliant on sponsorship. Each year it is a pleasure to welcome back a fantastic group of sponsors and to welcome new faces to our event.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to consider joining the list of sponsors below then please take a look <a href="[% make_uri('sponsoring.html') %]">at our sponsorship packages</a>. For all of those who visit the event or support the London Perl Workshop please consider visiting our sponsors and if you meet them in person thank them for their continued efforts to support our community and its projects and events.

</div></div>

<p>Perl Careers is a Perl-focused recruitment consultancy, run by a CPAN contributor with a recruitment background, rather than by a non-technical person. I can understand the skills you're looking to hire for, make sense of your GitHub profile, and offer specific Perl-related career and salary advice. I am very picky about only recruiting for companies I'd want to work at, and placing candidates who I'd want to work with. I'd love to talk to you if you think you might be either.</p>

<p>If you're a candidate and you'd like a second pair of eyes on your CV or résumé, want a confidential run-down on a company you're thinking of applying for (whether or not we work with them), want some recommendations on what employers are looking for, or want to know if you're being paid properly, I'd be happy to have an informal chat.</p>

<p>If you're a hiring manager and you'd like some advice on your job ads, some thoughts on free and paid channels for advertising for candidates, guidance on market salaries, or if you're non-technical and just need some help fleshing out what your actual requirements are, I'd be happy to have a commitment free chat.</p>

<p>Most of the candidates I place weren't actively looking for roles, and weren't available to traditional recruiters. Many of the most rewarding companies to work for aren't actively looking to hire, but if a recruiter who understands the candidate's strengths and the company's needs puts them together, they'll find a place. You can email me at: <a href="mailto:pete@perl.careers">pete@perl.careers</a></p>

<h2>The Trampery at Old Street, London</h2>

<p>This year's workshop will be held at <a href="https://thetrampery.com/spaces/venue-hire/">The Trampery</a>, at Old Street. A dedicated modern event space in central London. We have hired both The Ballroom and The Library; allowing us to run a main track for up to 160 attendees, and second smaller track for up to 35 attendees.</p>

<h2>Location &amp; Getting There</h2>
<p>The Trampery in Old Street is located <a href="https://g.page/thetrampery?share">a two minute walk</a> from the Northern Line's Old Street tube station in central London. The Northern Line has stops at most of the major train stations in London, or trivial links to others, so we recommend taking the tube to get to the venue.</p>
